                 The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn in 1957 to LA
                 and play at Dodger Stadium. Since they have came 
                 to LA they have had some of the biggest names in 
                 baseball on there team. Some examples are Clayton
                 Kershaw, Duke Snider, Tommy Lasorda, and many other
                 names. One of there most famous members of the team 
                 is the sports caster Vin Skully who has been with the 
                 Dodgers since Brooklyn in 1950. Vin Skully is set to 
                 retire this year at the age of 88. While the Dodgers 
                 have been in LA they have won six World Series. They 
                 have also appeared in 9 World Series. Although most
                 of the Dodger community because the team is only being
                 broadcasted on Time Warner Cable and only 30% of LA can
                 even see it so the only way we can see the games now is 
                 if you go to the Stadium and pay about $150 dollars for 
                 good seats to see one Dodger game. Most die hard fans have
                 already switched to Time Warmer Cable the rest of us never 
                 get to see any of the game.
