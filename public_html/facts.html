                    FUN FACTS<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    The Dodgers Franchise has had a interesting things
                    about them that not a lot of people know about.<br >
                    
                    Fun Fact#1- The Stadium in LA was built on top
                    of a ravine where there were homes with people 
                    living in these homes. The Police and other forms
                    of goverment workers had to come in and get the
                    people out of their homes and if you look it up 
                    online you can see photos of people being dragged
                    out of their homes.<br >
                
                    Fun Fact#2- The San Fransisco Giants and The Dodgers 
                    came to California at the same time and there rivalry 
                    was actually carried over from cities and now that one 
                    team is in San Fansisco and the other is in LA their
                    rivalry got worse because of the cities own rivalry 
                    between economy, politics, and now sports.<br >
                    
                    Fun Fact#3- Even after the head coach of the team left
                    Don Mattingly still manages the team and goes to most 
                    games.<br >
                  
                    Fun Fact#4- The Dodgers now have one of the best pitches
                    in MLB history. His name is Clayton Kershaw is in the top
                    ten list of most strikeouts with his Nasty Curveball.<br >
                    
                    Fun Fact#5- When the Dodgers moved to LA they did not yet
                    have there own field to play on. In fact they did not have 
                    a field for about 3 years. But in 1961 Dodger Stadium opened
                    and it is now the third oldest baseball stadium that is still 
                    operational.<br >
